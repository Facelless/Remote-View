## RemoteView - Remote Screen Monitoring

**RemoteView** is a remote monitoring system built in Python that uses **sockets** to capture and stream a computer screen in real time to another device.

##  Features

-  **Real-Time Streaming** – View the monitored device’s screen with minimal delay.  
-  **Socket-Based Communication** – Efficient client–server connection for smooth data transfer.  
-  **Easy Integration** – Can be adapted for various uses such as remote support or surveillance.  
-  **Customizable Code** – Modify and expand the project as needed.

## 🛠 Installation & Usage

###  Requirements

-  **Python 3.6+**
-  **Required Libraries**: `socket`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `pyautogui`

###  Running the Project

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Facelless/Remote-View.git
cd Remote-View
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Starting the Server

```bash
python main.py
```

### 💻 Starting the Client

```bash
python server.py
```

##  How It Works

- The **server** captures and streams the screen to connected clients.  
- The **client** receives and displays the real-time screen stream.  
- Communication relies on **sockets** to ensure efficient and stable transmission.
